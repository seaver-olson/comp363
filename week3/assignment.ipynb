    "The code below is based on the [work we did in the classroom](https://github.com/lgreco/comp-363-f25-live-coding/blob/main/week03/huffman.ipynb) this week. We are given a binary tree [`Node` object](./Node.py) and a few basic methods towards building a Huffman encoder/decoder. Your assignment is to complete the Huffman encoder/decoder according to the following specifications.\n",

    "There is no final exam for the course. There will be a final assignemnt that will be published the week before finals and will be due the week of finals. Additionally, 8 students in the course will be invited randomly to a brief meeting with the instructor during the course's final exam slot. If you are selected for a brief meeting, we'll spend about 15 minutes during the final exam slot to review your work. This interview will cover coding practices based on your past assignments. It is meant as a checkpoint to ensure that you have internalized the work you submitted.\n"
