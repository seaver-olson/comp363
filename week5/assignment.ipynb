Additionally, 8 students in the course will be invited randomly to a brief meeting with the instructor during the course's final exam slot. If you are selected for a brief meeting, we'll spend about 15 minutes during the final exam slot to review your work. This interview will cover coding practices based on your past assignments. It is meant as a checkpoint to ensure that you have internalized the work you submitted.\n"

    "### Optimal alignment with $x_m$ and $y_n$ in last column\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem:** An optimal alignment of $X$ and $Y$ that contains $x_m$ and $y_n$ in its last column, comprises an optimal alignment of $X_{m-1}$ and $Y_{n-1}$ as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $X_i$ is the substring with the first $i$ characters of $X$ and $Y_j$ is the substring with the first $j$ characters of $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof:** Let $P$ be the penalty for the optimal alignment of $X'x_m$ and $Y'y_n$. The penalty for the alignment $X'$ and $Y$ is then $P'= P-\\alpha_{x_m y_n}$. That's the penalty of the optimal alignment minus the score associated with the match of $x_m$ and $y_n$ in the last column, since $X'$ and $Y'$ represent the optimal alignment with its last column removed. We claim that $P'$ is the minimum penalty for aligning $X_{m-1}$ and $Y_{n-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that there is an other aligment of $X_{m-1}$ and $Y_{n-1}$ whose penalty is $P^* < P'$. If we add to this new alignment the column $\\left|\\begin{array}{c}x_m\\\\ y_n\\end{array}\\right|$, we'll get:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "P^* + a_{x_m y_n} < P' + a_{x_m y_n}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting $P'=P-a_{x_m y_n}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "P^* + a_{x_m y_n} &< (P-a_{x_m y_n}) + a_{x_m y_n} \\\\\n",
    "P^* + a_{x_m y_n} &< P\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the aligmnent of  $X_{m-1}$ and $Y_{n-1}$ with penalty $P^*$ augmented by $x_m$ and $y_n$ at its end, has a smaller penalty than that of the optimal alignment of $X$ and $Y$. Which is a contradiction, prooving that $X'$ and $Y'$ is an optimal alignment of  $X_{m-1}$ and $Y_{n-1}$.\n",

    "### Optimal alignment with $x_m$ over a gap in last column\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem:** if the last column of the optimal alignment of $X$ and $Y$ is $\\left|\\begin{array}{c}x_m\\\\ \\text{gap}\\end{array}\\right|$ then the rest of the alignment (when the last column is removed) is an optimal alignment of $X_{m-1}$ and $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof:** Let $P$ be the total penalty for the optimal alignment of $X$ and $Y$, and $P'$ the penalty of the alignment between $X_{m-1}$ and $Y$. Then $P'=P-a_\\text{gap}$. If $P'$ does not correspond to the optimal alignment of $X_{m-1}$ and $Y$, there must be another optimal alignment for these strings with penanlty $P^*<P'=P-\\alpha_\\text{gap}$. Adding the last column $\\left|\\begin{array}{c}x_m\\\\ \\text{gap}\\end{array}\\right|$ to $P^*$ we get: $P^*+\\alpha_\\text{gap}< P$, i.e., there is an alignment for strings $X$ and $Y$ whose penalty is less than that of their optimal alignment, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the rest of the alignment of $X$ and $Y$ when we remove its last column $\\left|\\begin{array}{c}x_m\\\\ \\text{gap}\\end{array}\\right|$ is an optimal alignment for $X_{m-1}$ and $Y$."
